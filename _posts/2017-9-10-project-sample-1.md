[Sen. John McCain (R)](https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography) from Arizona has his concerns about North Korea, as many people have. He believes that the United States should find a way to combat North Korea's aggressive stances - and if the aggression continues, then to reassures leader [Kim Jong Un](https://www.biography.com/people/kim-jong-un-21125351) that 'his aggressive acts will lead to his country's destruction.' Following [U.S Secretary of Defense James Mattis's](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography-View/Article/1055835/james-mattis/) and [President Donald Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump) pleas to North Korea and Jong-un's refusal to comply, North Korea may be met with a 'harsh response.'

North Korea, officially known as the DPRK, has been notorious for lately disregarding the pleas and requests of councils, countries, and diplomats. No matter the response, they've exhausted a lot of effort into reasoning with them. However, North Korea is continuing to be a real and concerning threat to the world. With their further development of nuclear capabilities and missles, it should be everyone's concern, and it is definitely one of mine and Senator McCain's. Whenever a country develops the likes of which North Korea has, and them being an unpredictable nation, so as far as launching into Japanese airspace, a lot of people are fearing for their lives when we've reached the low end of diplomatic solutions.

Foreign policy has been very difficult with North Korea, and it's not to anyone's surprise as to how far we've come with trying to change their course of action. Sanctioning, denouncing, and any measure taken has only fueled more of the reason for them to develop farther capabilities- and it shouldn't be taken lightly. World cooperation may be required; world stabilility may be at stake; and lives will be at stake, should one detonate in hostile intention. Everyone will feel impact in some way, no matter the country, because we don't truly know the intentions of North Korea other than for them to inscribe fear into everyone's minds.

Putting all the cards on the table, North Korea should be met with any further options available all but full-scale war, because such a tragedy would harm all generations, all around the world. Extinction should not be an option, unless North Korea initiates war.
